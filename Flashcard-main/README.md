# Flashcard
Flashcards are a great tool when you want to memorize a new topic or learn a new
language. You write a question on the front of the card and the answer on the back of
the card. Then you can test your memory by going through the flashcards. The more
often you show a card to yourself, the better your chances of memorizing its content.
